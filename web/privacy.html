    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>Last updated: January 20, 2026</p>

    <p><strong>Swift Reader</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") is dedicated to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy
        explains how your information is handled when you use our application.</p>

    <h2>1. Data Collection and Usage</h2>
    <p>Swift Reader is designed as a <strong>local-first</strong> application. We do not collect, store, or transmit
        your personal data, reading history, or uploaded files to any external servers owned by us.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Reading Material:</strong> Books (EPUB, PDF) and text you upload are processed entirely on your
            device.</li>
        <li><strong>Library Data:</strong> Your reading progress, bookmarks, and settings are stored locally on your
            device using your browser's or phone's local storage capabilities.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Permissions</h2>
    <p>The app may request the following permissions to function:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Storage / File Access:</strong> Required to open and read the book files you select from your
            device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>We do not use third-party analytics services that track your behavior. The app is hosted on GitHub Pages, which
        may collect standard server access logs (IP address, user agent) for security and maintenance purposes.</p>

    <h2>4. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our service does not address anyone under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable
        information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>5. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically for
        any changes. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>6. Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us.</p>
