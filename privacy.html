        <li><strong>Internet</strong>: To provide web-based features and fetch necessary libraries.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All app data, including your reading history, statistics, and book metadata, is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>. We do not have access to this data.</p>
